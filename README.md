pebble-accel-analyzer
=====================

Skeleton pebble + android + flask app to just pull AccelData from pebble watch to a DB.  For use in analyzing accelerometer data.

Currently using MongoDB as the backend for storing the accelerometer data.

Each component currently builds and installs with some work on my setup.  Probably will not work out of the box for others yet, will check in build scripts, virtualenv stuff, etc. soon.
